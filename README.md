# Interactive Highways

This notebook demonstrate an example of creating **interactive highways using Python**. The goal of this exercise is to allow to focus on cartographic visuzalization with Python.

In details, this project demonstrates how to overlay highway features on Open Street Map (OSM) on the example of Highways 407, 412 and 418. Also, it shows how to add basic highway metrics, like Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), and make highway features interactactive by clicking on them.

The AADT values for 2018 and 2019 provided in the attributes file are fictional, and are used for demonstration purposes only

The final result can be viewed in [My interactive map](https://da-rocket.github.io/Interactive_highways/interactive_highway.html)
